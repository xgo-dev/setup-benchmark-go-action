# Setup Benchmark Go

Record standard Go benchmark output on one or more GitHub Actions runners,
compare each platform with its matching `main` history, update one pull request
comment, and publish long-term charts with GitHub Pages.

The recorder does not install Go or Node, run `go`, or inspect toolchain caches.
Projects keep full control of benchmark execution; this action only parses the
result file and uploads a validated artifact.

## Results

The publisher creates one bot comment and updates it for later commits:

![Benchmark pull request comment](docs/images/pr-comment.png)

GitHub Pages keeps long-term Main and Branch trends. A merged commit extends the
Main series:

![Main benchmark history](docs/images/pages-main.png)

Pull request pages show the measured base and current head from the same runner
job, while the head branch keeps the long-term history:

![Pull request benchmark history](docs/images/pages-pull-request.png)

## Quick Start

Create `.github/go-benchmark.yml`:

```yaml
id: my-project
title: My project benchmarks
groups:
  core: "^Core.*$"
  runtime: "^(Runtime|Scheduler).*$"
  parser:
    match: "^Parse.*$"
    chart: single
```

Record benchmarks in `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`:

```yaml
name: Go benchmarks

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  benchmark:
    if: >-
      github.event_name != 'push' ||
      github.ref_name == github.event.repository.default_branch
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v6
        with:
          go-version-file: go.mod
      - name: Run benchmarks
        run: go test -run '^$' -bench '^Benchmark' -benchmem -count=5 ./... | tee benchmark.txt
      - uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action@v1
        with:
          config: .github/go-benchmark.yml
          benchmark-file: benchmark.txt

  publish:
    if: >-
      github.event_name == 'push' &&
      github.ref_name == github.event.repository.default_branch
    needs: benchmark
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: write
    uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action/.github/workflows/publish.yml@v1
    with:
      run_id: ${{ fromJSON(github.run_id) }}
      source_mode: current-run
```

Publish pull request results from a trusted workflow on the default branch.
Create
`.github/workflows/benchmark-publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish Go benchmarks

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [Go benchmarks]
    types: [completed]

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  publish:
    if: >-
      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' &&
      github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request'
    uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action/.github/workflows/publish.yml@v1
    with:
      run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
```

The two publisher modes separate trust from benchmark execution. A
default-branch push may use `current-run` after its benchmark jobs. Pull request
code only produces artifacts; the trusted `workflow_run` publisher validates
them before writing PR and branch history or updating the comment. Before each
remote write, it also verifies that the pull request still points at the
measured commit.

Existing publishers need no migration: `source_mode` defaults to
`workflow-run`, which continues to support default-branch pushes, branches, and
pull requests. When adding the direct `current-run` job above, restrict the
`workflow_run` job to pull requests as shown to avoid publishing the same main
run twice.

By default, data and the generated site are committed atomically to a `pages`
branch in the project repository. In **Settings > Pages**, select **Deploy from
a branch**, then choose `pages` and `/ (root)`.

## Configuration

Patterns use RE2 syntax and are matched against all of:

- short name: `CoreRead`
- benchmark name: `BenchmarkCoreRead`
- package-qualified short name: `example.org/project/pkg::CoreRead`
- package-qualified benchmark name:
  `example.org/project/pkg::BenchmarkCoreRead`

The shorthand group form assigns a combined chart:

```yaml
groups:
  core: "^Core.*$"
```

Use the object form for a display title, several patterns, or one chart per
benchmark:

```yaml
version: 1
id: my-project
title: My project benchmarks
site-path: go-benchmarks/my-project
include:
  - "^Benchmark"
exclude: "^Experimental"
max-benchmarks: 500
groups:
  storage:
    title: Storage
    match:
      - "^(File|Database)"
    chart: combined
  parser:
    match: "^Parse"
    chart: single
```

| Field               | Default              | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`           | `1`                  | Configuration schema version.                                      |
| `id`                | required             | Stable suite ID using lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-`. |
| `title`             | `<id> benchmarks`    | Report and site title.                                             |
| `site-path`         | `go-benchmarks/<id>` | Site directory within the data branch.                             |
| `include`           | `^Benchmark`         | RE2 pattern or pattern list selecting benchmarks.                  |
| `exclude`           | none                 | RE2 pattern or pattern list applied after `include`.               |
| `max-benchmarks`    | `500`                | Maximum selected benchmarks, from 1 through 5000.                  |
| `groups`            | none                 | Named chart groups. Group IDs are lowercase path-safe names.       |
| `groups.<id>.title` | title-cased ID       | Display title.                                                     |
| `groups.<id>.match` | required             | RE2 pattern or pattern list.                                       |
| `groups.<id>.chart` | `combined`           | `combined` or `single`.                                            |
| `views`             | none                 | Optional pivot tables for the pull request comment.                |

A benchmark may match at most one group. Overlap is rejected instead of
silently selecting a group. Included benchmarks that match no group remain
visible under **Other**, with a separate chart for each benchmark. This lets new
benchmarks appear without first changing configuration.

## Comment Views

Without `views`, the pull request comment uses the default long form:

```text
Group | Benchmark | Metric | Current | vs main
```

Views provide a constrained data pivot for richer reports. They do not change
the artifact schema, stored history, or Pages charts. Each measurement is an
observation with five available dimensions:

- `platform`
- `package`
- `group`
- `benchmark`
- `metric`

A view selects observations and places dimensions in table rows, columns, or
split sections. This layout produces one row per platform and workload, with
file size, build time, and run time as columns:

```yaml
groups:
  programs: "^Program/"
  core: "^Core"

views:
  programs:
    title: Program measurements
    select:
      groups: "^programs$"
    table:
      rows: [platform, benchmark]
      columns: [metric]
      missing: error
      dimensions:
        benchmark:
          title: Workload
          trim-prefix: BenchmarkProgram/
      metrics:
        binary-bytes:
          title: File size
          format: bytes
        build-ns:
          title: Build
          format: duration-ns
        run-ns:
          title: Run
          format: duration-ns

  core:
    title: Core language and compiler benchmarks
    select:
      groups: "^core$"
    table:
      rows: [platform, benchmark]
      columns: [metric]
      collapsed: true
```

The corresponding standard benchmark record may contain several metrics:

```text
Unit binary-bytes better=lower assume=exact
Unit build-ns better=lower
Unit run-ns better=lower
BenchmarkProgram/cprintf 1 18264 binary-bytes 354926000 build-ns 1274000 run-ns
```

### View Selection

`select` accepts one RE2 pattern or a pattern list for each dimension:

| Selector     | Matched values                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `platforms`  | Platform ID and display label.                          |
| `packages`   | Go package path.                                        |
| `groups`     | Group ID and display title.                             |
| `benchmarks` | Full key, benchmark name, and name without `Benchmark`. |
| `metrics`    | Metric or unit name.                                    |

Selectors within one field are ORed; different fields are ANDed. Observations
may intentionally appear in more than one view.

### Table Layout

| Field        | Default                 | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rows`       | `[platform, benchmark]` | Dimensions identifying each table row.                             |
| `columns`    | `[metric]`              | Dimensions expanded into value and `vs main` column pairs.         |
| `split-by`   | none                    | Dimensions that produce separate tables inside the view.           |
| `collapsed`  | `false`                 | Put the view in a Markdown `<details>` section.                    |
| `missing`    | `blank`                 | Use `blank` for `-` cells or `error` to require a complete matrix. |
| `empty`      | `hide`                  | Use `hide` or fail with `error` when selection is empty.           |
| `max-rows`   | `200`                   | Per-table row limit, from 1 through 1000.                          |
| `dimensions` | none                    | Override dimension titles or trim a literal value prefix.          |
| `metrics`    | none                    | Override metric titles, ordering, and display formats.             |

Every dimension may be used at most once across `rows`, `columns`, and
`split-by`. If omitted dimensions make two observations resolve to the same
cell, rendering fails instead of choosing one result. `missing: error` also
turns a sparse pivot into an explicit failure.

Platforms can be columns instead of rows:

```yaml
table:
  rows: [benchmark, metric]
  columns: [platform]
```

Or each platform can have its own compact table:

```yaml
table:
  rows: [benchmark]
  columns: [metric]
  split-by: [platform]
```

Metric configuration is optional. Listed metrics appear first in declaration
order; other selected metrics follow alphabetically. Supported formats are:

| Format        | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `auto`        | Number followed by its metric name.        |
| `number`      | Number without a unit suffix.              |
| `bytes`       | Exact byte value with `B`.                 |
| `duration-ns` | Duration whose input unit is nanoseconds.  |
| `duration-us` | Duration whose input unit is microseconds. |
| `duration-ms` | Duration whose input unit is milliseconds. |
| `duration-s`  | Duration whose input unit is seconds.      |

Duration formats choose a readable `ns`, `us`, `ms`, or `s` display unit. The
underlying value and historical comparison remain in the original metric.
Reports that exceed GitHub's comment size limit fail with a clear error; use
selectors, split views, or Pages for larger suites.

## Measurements

Input is ordinary `go test -bench` output. Package names, `goos`, and `goarch`
are read from the standard header:

```text
goos: linux
goarch: amd64
pkg: example.org/project/parser
BenchmarkParseSmall-8  125000  912.4 ns/op  64 B/op  1 allocs/op
```

Every reported metric is retained. Repeated samples, such as `-count=5`, are
stored and the median becomes the displayed and historical value. The action
does not average results from different platforms.

Common Go units have their usual direction automatically: lower is better for
`ns/op`, `sec/op`, `B/op`, and `allocs/op`; higher is better for `MB/s` and
`B/s`. Custom metrics can declare metadata in the benchmark output:

```text
Unit requests/s better=higher
Unit binary-bytes better=lower assume=exact
```

Supported metadata is:

| Metadata | Values             | Meaning                                        |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `better` | `lower`, `higher`  | Marks a PR delta as better or worse.           |
| `assume` | `nothing`, `exact` | Records the benchmark's comparison assumption. |

Units come from benchmark output, not the YAML configuration. A unit is never
combined with another unit.

## Matrices And Shards

Each recorder job uploads one artifact. `shard-id` defaults to `GITHUB_JOB`.
Different jobs may contribute disjoint benchmarks to the same platform; the
publisher merges them before making its single data commit and single PR
comment.

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    suite: [core, storage]
steps:
  - run: go test -run '^$' -bench . -count=5 ./bench/${{ matrix.suite }} | tee benchmark.txt
  - uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action@v1
    with:
      config: .github/go-benchmark.yml
      benchmark-file: benchmark.txt
      shard-id: ${{ matrix.suite }}
```

The publisher rejects duplicate shard IDs, duplicate benchmarks across shards,
configuration differences, unit metadata conflicts, platform label conflicts,
and source commit mismatches. This makes partial or ambiguous matrix output a
hard failure instead of publishing misleading data.

Platform ID and label normally come from the benchmark `goos` and `goarch`.
Set them explicitly for cross compilation, virtual environments, or a Go
version matrix:

```yaml
- uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action@v1
  with:
    config: .github/go-benchmark.yml
    benchmark-file: benchmark.txt
    platform-id: ubuntu-go1.26-amd64
    platform-label: Ubuntu / amd64 / Go 1.26
    shard-id: ${{ github.job }}-${{ matrix.package }}
```

Two Go versions on the same OS and architecture must use distinct platform IDs.
Only equal platform IDs are merged or compared.

## Published Results

The generated Pages site keeps separate **Main**, **Branches**, and **Pull
requests** views. Each measured commit is stored directly at
`commits/<sha>.json`, so its complete platform results can be found without
recovering an older version of a shared history file. Pull request commit files
also include the paired same-runner base observation used for their comparison.

Main and branch series write a combined `summary.json` containing up to 500
measured commits in chronological order. A pull request run updates both its
branch summary and a compact PR summary containing only the paired base (when
available) and the current head. Existing `history.json` data is merged into the
new layout automatically. A synchronized compatibility copy is kept during the
transition so workflow runs that started with an older action bundle can still
publish without losing history.

For a pull request, the publisher creates one bot comment and updates that same
comment on later commits. Within each platform, either every shard includes
`baseline-benchmark-file` or none does. Platforms with a baseline compare each
metric with that paired observation measured by the same runner job; the report
links the baseline commit and labels the comparison `vs base`. A newly added
platform may omit its baseline and is marked `new` without weakening pairing on
the other platforms. When no platform has a paired baseline, each metric is
compared with the newest matching platform in `main`. If neither baseline
exists, including the first setup PR in a new project, the report succeeds and
marks every metric as `new`. Each comparison displays both the signed difference
in the metric's unit and the percentage change.

If the two files contain deliberately index-paired repetitions, set
`sample-pairing: index`. The report then uses the medians of pairwise signed
differences and percentage changes instead of differences between two independent medians.
The recorder rejects missing benchmarks, units, or samples rather than silently
breaking the pairing.

The recorder derives baseline repository, commit, and ref from the pull request
base. The trusted publisher requires the baseline repository to match the pull
request target and rebuilds its commit link on the trusted GitHub host. The
metadata can be supplied explicitly for other events:

```yaml
- uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action@v1
  with:
    config: .github/go-benchmark.yml
    benchmark-file: pr.txt
    baseline-benchmark-file: main.txt
    sample-pairing: index
```

Run both files in one job on the same runner. A workflow should reuse dependency
setup and may reuse build caches for unchanged packages to keep the paired run
short.

The publisher also uploads a rendered preview artifact and writes the report to
the job summary. Pull requests from forks use the same history and comment flow.
Every PR artifact must report the exact repository and commit from the trusted
run metadata. Before persistent PR or branch publishing, its configuration must
exactly match `config_path` on the default branch; a first setup PR without that
file still gets a preview and comment but cannot write Pages data. The data
token is never available to the pull request workflow.

### External Data Repository

The default `pages` branch can live in another repository:

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    uses: xgo-dev/setup-benchmark-go-action/.github/workflows/publish.yml@v1
    with:
      run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
      data_repository: owner/project-benchmark-data
      data_dispatch_event: go-benchmarks-published
      config_path: .github/project-benchmark.yml
    secrets:
      data_token: ${{ secrets.BENCHMARK_DATA_TOKEN }}
```

`data_token` needs contents write access to the data repository. The optional
`data_dispatch_event` sends a `repository_dispatch` event to that repository
after its data is ready, using the same token. Configure Pages there from its
`pages` branch or handle that event with a Pages deployment workflow. If the
Pages URL is nonstandard, set `site_base_url`.

An external repository and token are optional for pull request reporting. If
the token is missing, the repository cannot be checked out for writing, the
push fails, or the deployment notification fails, the publisher keeps the
rendered preview and adds a warning to its pull request comment instead of
failing. Artifact download, trusted configuration, source validation, and
rendering errors still fail the workflow.

Recommended publisher permissions are `actions: read`, `contents: write`,
`issues: write`, and `pull-requests: write`. A direct main-only publisher does
not need the issue or pull request permissions. GitHub may reduce permissions
passed to a reusable workflow, so the publisher inherits only the permissions
explicitly granted by its caller.

## Runtime And Security

Parsing and rendering execute through `actions/github-script@v8` on the
runner-provided Node 24 runtime. The action is isolated from a consumer's
`setup-go`, `setup-node`, Go cache, Node cache, and selected toolchain versions.
It has no production dependency on the Go toolchain.

Artifacts contain JSON data and a configuration snapshot, never executable
code. Before merging shards, commenting, or writing history, the publisher
validates schema versions, URLs, labels, metric values, sample medians,
configuration, layouts, units, platforms, and size limits. `workflow-run`
accepts only its triggering run ID, while `current-run` accepts only the current
default-branch push. Series type, repository, branch, and commit identity come
from GitHub's run metadata rather than the artifact. Every PR or branch result
must match the configured file on the default branch before it can persist
data. The trusted publisher also restricts paired baselines to the pull request
target repository and rebuilds trusted source URLs.

The trusted publisher serializes writes per data repository and publishes one
commit after all platform artifacts have passed validation.

## Development

The implementation requires Node 24:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
npm audit --omit=dev
npm run benchmark
```

`npm run build` updates both checked-in bundles: `dist/index.js` and
`publish/dist/index.js`.
